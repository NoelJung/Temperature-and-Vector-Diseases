      "description": "A website on the effects of changing temperature on the spread of Vector Borne Diseases\n",
      "author": [],
      "contents": "\nIntroduction\nWest Nile and Lyme Disease are both examples of vector borne\ndiseases. Vector borne diseases are diseases that are transmitted by the\nbite of an infected animal. Specifically for West Nile and Lyme, a\nmosquito bite and a tick bite respectively are capable of transmitting\nthe virus into a human host to cause the disease.\nHowever, both mosquitoes and ticks are sensitive to their\nenvironment. Specifically, changing temperature can change how well\nmosquitoes or ticks are able to survive and thrive. This changes the\nnumber of active mosquitoes or ticks that can transmit these viruses,\nthus impacting the number of cases that appear. In this website, I will\ntry to explore this relationship by comparing annual average\ntemperatures the number of cases of each disease in the US.\nWest Nile Disease\nWest Nile Disease is spread by mosquito bites. Specifically for\nmosquitoes, higher temperatures creates optimal conditions for them to\nthrive, allowing them to:\nRemain active for more parts of the year\nDevelop at a faster rate to reach full adulthood\nThese conditions allow mosquitoes to proliferate earlier and for\nlonger periods of time. This gives mosquitoes more opportunities to\nspread the West Nile Virus, thus increasing the number of cases.\n\n\n\nOf course, this is how this is supposed to work on paper. In reality,\nthere are a multitude of other variables that are contribute to how well\nmosquitoes are able to transmit West Nile, something which can be seen\nand is explained in the West Nile Disease section of this website.\nLyme Disease\nComparatively, Lyme Disease is spread by tick bites. While higher\ntemperatures are great for mosquitoes, they are not ideal for ticks.\nSpecifically, the black-legged tick, the type of tick that spreads Lyme\nDisease, high temperatures cause them to become less active as they\nprefer cooler temperatures, typically between 4 and 25 degrees Celsius\n(39.2 to 77 degrees Fahrenheit).\n\n\n\nTherefore, higher temperatures can both be beneficial and detrimental\nfor ticks. Higher temperatures in cold areas, can create a climate ideal\nfor ticks to survive thus increasing their ability to spread Lyme\nDisease. However higher temperatures in warm areas can create overly hot\nclimates that can reduce tick activity, reducing their ability to spread\nLyme Disease.\nAgain however, this is only how it works on paper. In reality, other\nvariables are also at play which change how well ticks are able to\nthrive in a given area, something which can be seen and is explained in\nthe Lyme Disease section of this website.\n\n\n\n",

The optimal\ntemperature for ticks is about 4 and 25 degrees Celsius (39.2 to 77\ndegrees Fahrenheit). As a result, on paper it is expected that as\ntemperatures warm to get within this range, tick activity would increase\nthus increasing the number of Lyme Disease cases. If conditions get too\nhot to exit this range, tick activity would decrease reducing the number\nof Lyme Disease cases.\nThis of course is not at all what is actually seen in the graphs\nbelow. Similar to the West Nile Disease graphs, the CDC only had data\nfrom 2010 to 2019, meaning only these years were considered. Annual\naverage temperature data was collected from the NOAA and annual number\nof Lyme Disease cases were collected from the CDC. The relationship\nbetween these two variables was investigated in the three states with\nthe highest number of Lyme Disease cases, Pennsylvania, New York and New\nJersey, and at a national level as well. Through these graphs we can see\nthat the effect of temperature on Lyme Disease cases varies wildly!\n#Images\n\ninclude_graphics(\"images/PenLy.png\")\n\ninclude_graphics(\"images/NewJLy.png\")\n\ninclude_graphics(\"images/NewYLy.png\")\n\ninclude_graphics(\"images/NatLy.png\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

      "contents": "\nWhy does temperature not affect the number of West Nile and Lyme\ndisease cases as expected? Mainly because there are a multitude of other\nfactors at play that also affect how well these diseases can\nproliferate.\nFactors\nAffecting How Well Ticks and Mosquitoes Can Infect People\nWhile temperature is a crucial factor to how well ticks and\nmosquitoes can thrive, there are other factors to consider such as:\nPrecipitation\nTicks prefer humid environments and mosquitoes need wet areas to lay\neggs and reproduce\nPrecipitation levels can thus change the population of ticks and\nmosquitoes in a given area meaning the rate at which ticks and\nmosquitoes can transmit West Nile or Lyme Disease is affected\n\nHuman Behaviour\nWearing bug spray, long sleeves and pants, or just staying inside\nare all ways humans limit the ability of ticks and mosquitoes to bite\nand transmit West Nile or Lyme Disease\n\nPopulation Density\nTicks generally remain in wooded, forest areas and mosquitoes\ntypically remain in areas where there is lots of stagnant water to lay\neggs\nIf there is a lack of people around these areas, the rate at which\nticks and mosquitoes can bite and thus transmit West Nile or Lyme\nDisease changes\n\nFactors\nAffecting How Well West Nile and Lyme Disease Can Proliferate\nOne other factor we have not considered is the way West Nile Disease\nor Lyme Disease can infect a mosquito or tick in the first place.\nMosquitoes typically become infected with West Nile Disease from\nbirds. Specifically, if they feed from a bird that has West Nile Disease\nin its blood, the virus will transmit to the mosquito. If that mosquito\nthen bites a human, the virus can then transmit to the person thus\ncausing West Nile Disease.\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Graphic Showing how the West Nile Virus Transfers\nfrom Bird to Mosquito to Human\nThe process in which ticks get infected is much the same. There is no\nspecific animal that ticks can contract the bacteria causing Lyme\nDisease from, however if it bites onto an infected animal, the bacteria\ncan latch to the tick. If the tick then bites a human, the bacteria can\ninfect that person causing Lyme Disease.\nHowever, changing conditions can affect how well mosquitoes and ticks\nare able to feed off of infected animals in the first place. For example\nin the case of West Nile disease, the most common type of bird that\nmosquitoes become infected from are birds from the Passeriforme order.\nChanging temperatures, precipitation and habitat conditions can result\nin changes to migratory patters, wintering groups and general behaviour\nof these birds. This changes the presence of Passeriforme birds in a\ngiven area, thus affecting how well a mosquito is able to become\ninfected with West Nile to spread in the first place.\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Picture of Common Passeriforme Birds\nBy preventing ticks or mosquitoes from becoming infected in the first\nplace, changing conditions can affect how well West Nile or Lyme Disease\nis able to spread to people.\nTherefore, in reality there are a multitude of other variables at\nplay that affect how well ticks and mosquitoes are able to spread Lyme\nand West Nile Disease respectively. While temperature certainly does\nplay a role, it is only one part of the puzzle and there are other\nfactors to consider.\n\n\n\n",

However, this is not supported by\nthe trends shown in the graphs below.\nThe graphs below use average annual temperature data collected by the\nNational Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration against the annual\nnumber of West Nile disease cases. The CDC contained West Nile Disease\ndata from 1999 to 2020, meaning only these years were considered. The\nannual temperature and case numbers were compared in the states of\nCalifornia, Colorado and Texas as they had the top three highest number\nof West Nile cases. A comparison between the national annual temperature\nthe national annual number of West Nile cases was also made in a final,\nfourth graph.
