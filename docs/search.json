      "contents": "\nIntroduction\nWest Nile and Lyme Disease are both examples of vector borne\ndiseases. Vector borne diseases are diseases that are transmitted by the\nbite of an infected animal. Specifically for West Nile and Lyme, a\nmosquito bite and a tick bite respectively are capable of transmitting\nthe virus into a human host to cause the disease.\nHowever, both mosquitoes and ticks are sensitive to their\nenvironment. Specifically, changing temperature can change how well\nmosquitoes or ticks are able to survive and thrive. This changes the\nnumber of active mosquitoes or ticks that can transmit these viruses,\nthus impacting the number of cases that appear. In this website, I will\ntry to explore this relationship by comparing annual average\ntemperatures the number of cases of each disease in the US.\nWest Nile Disease\nWest Nile Disease is spread by mosquito bites. Specifically for\nmosquitoes, higher temperatures creates optimal conditions for them to\nthrive, allowing them to:\nRemain active for more parts of the year\nDevelop at a faster rate to reach full adulthood\nThese conditions allow mosquitoes to proliferate earlier and for\nlonger periods of time. This gives mosquitoes more opportunities to\nspread the West Nile Virus, thus increasing the number of cases.\nOf course, this is how this is supposed to work on paper. In reality,\nthere are a multitude of other variables that are contribute to how well\nmosquitoes are able to transmit West Nile, something which can be seen\nand is explained in the West Nile Disease section of this website.\nLyme Disease\nComparatively, Lyme Disease is spread by tick bites. While higher\ntemperatures are great for mosquitoes, they are not ideal for ticks.\nSpecifically, the black-legged tick, the type of tick that spreads Lyme\nDisease, high temperatures cause them to become less active as they\nprefer cooler temperatures, typically between 4 and 25 degrees Celsius\n(39.2 to 77 degrees Fahrenheit).\nTherefore, higher temperatures can both be beneficial and detrimental\nfor ticks. Higher temperatures in cold areas, can create a climate ideal\nfor ticks to survive thus increasing their ability to spread Lyme\nDisease. However higher temperatures in warm areas can create overly hot\nclimates that can reduce tick activity, reducing their ability to spread\nLyme Disease.\nAgain however, this is only how it works on paper. In reality, other\nvariables are also at play which change how well ticks are able to\nthrive in a given area, something which can be seen and is explained in\nthe Lyme Disease section of this website.\n\n\n\n",
